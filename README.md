# Lead-Scoring

## ML model that predicts Leads with a sighnificant chance of conversion thereby improving converson rates and company revenue!

## Problem Statement:
- An education company named X Education sells online courses to industry professionals
- Although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example, if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted. To make this process more efficient, the company wishes to identify the most potential leads, also known as ‘Hot Leads’. If they successfully identify this set of leads, the lead conversion rate should go up as the sales team will now be focusing more on communicating with the potential leads rather than making calls to everyone.
- To find the most promising leads, i.e. the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers, I created a model that assigns a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score will have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. As per CEO's feedback a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

I used several classification model to predict whether the lead is going to quantify as a hot lead. The steps involved for this project are mentioned below:
- Data Loading
- Data Exploration a.k.a Exploratory Data Analysis
- Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Outlier Analysis
- Model Building
- Model Performance Benchmarking
- Model Performance Evaluation
- Cross Validation + Hyperparameter Tuning
- Model Diagnosis Using Probability Calibration, ROC AUC Curve, Precision-Recall Curve
